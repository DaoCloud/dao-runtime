Runtime Client
==============

Intro
-----
Runtime client implemented in Go. This is simply for demonstration purpose.

Build
-----
Install godep (this can be skipped, because of no deps).

	$ go get github.com/tools/godep

Build

	$ godep go build

Run

	$ ./client -name runtime1

This requires runtime server to be started.
